# Game Store Project

## Overview
This project is a simple game store application written in C++ that provides users with a variety of fun games. The program begins with a basic login system, then presents the user with multiple game options to choose from.

## Program Structure
The program is organized into several main functions, including:
1. **log_in()**: A login function where the user must enter a username and password to access the games.
2. **options()**: Displays a list of available games for the user.
3. **log_out()**: Checks if the user wants to log out or continue playing.

## Available Games
The program offers four different games:
1. **Guess the Number**:
   - The player tries to guess a random number between 0 and 15 with a limit of 8 attempts.
2. **Test Your General Knowledge**:
   - A simple quiz that asks 5 multiple-choice questions.
3. **Attack on Monsters**:
   - A monster battle game where the player selects a monster type and uses different skills to inflict damage on the opponent.
4. **Stone-Paper-Scissors**:
   - A classic "Rock-Paper-Scissors" game where the player competes against the computer for 3 rounds.
